# 100-Days-Of-ML
what is this ?

100 Days of Code is a challenge/community, where you publicly commit to code for 1 hour for the next 100 days (it is however more flexible than that). You also become a part of a large friendly dev community.

Two Main Rules:
- Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
- Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag
